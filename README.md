# cc-auto-project

A project to automate stuff in Minecraft via CC: Tweaked mod.

## Project idea

This project is made to control robots inside the Minecraft world. It might tell
the robot to chop woods, mine, build, and farm from an external GUI: a web interface.

## Setting up the project

Before you set up the project, you will need [`node.js`](https://nodejs.org/en/)
(recommended version 16 or up) and `npm` installed on the device you're setting
up the project in.

To get started, install the dependencies by running:

    npm install

After the dependencies are installed, you can instantly run the project (with hot reload) by
running:

    npm run dev

If you want to build the optimized version and run it from there, you can run:

    npm run build
    npm run start
